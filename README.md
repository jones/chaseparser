# chaseparser [v1.0]
***

`chaseparser` calculates how much money you've spent with your Chase credit card. Surprisingly this feature isn't availibe on the chase website so I've written a quick script to fix that. This script is invaluable for those for trying to make their sign-up bonus and need to know how close they are to their goal.
